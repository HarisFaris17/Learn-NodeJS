// we can use REPL ( remember command windows in matlab/octave) in node.js just by typing "node" in cmd
// every enter in REPL will display the returned value of the code entered. And also display all console.log
// if we want to coding in long rows, hence we should switch to editor mode
// to enter editor mode, type ".editor" while we are in REPL state
// to exit REPL mode type ".exit"
